### High Speed BLS12-381 Implementation in Go

#### Pairing Instance

A Group instance or a pairing engine instance _is not_ suitable for concurrent processing since an instance has its own preallocated memory for temporary variables. A new instance must be created for each thread.

#### Base Field

x86 optimized base field is generated with [kilic/fp](https://github.com/kilic/fp) and for native go is generated with [goff](https://github.com/ConsenSys/goff). Generated codes are slightly edited in both for further requirements.

#### Scalar Field

Both standart big.Int module and x86 optimized implementation are available for scalar field elements and opereations.

#### Serialization

Point serialization is in line with [zkcrypto library](https://github.com/zkcrypto/pairing/tree/master/src/bls12_381#serialization).

#### Hashing to Curve

Hashing to curve implementations for both G1 and G2 follows `_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_` and `_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_NU_` suites as defined in `v7` of [irtf hash to curve draft](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/).

#### Benchmarks
