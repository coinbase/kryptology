# Secure Two-party Threshold ECDSA from ECDSA Assumptions

**IMPORTANT**: Version 0 of the protocol is experimental and not suitable for production use.
It is kept here for backward compatability.
We have added type conversion functions in the Version 1 package that can be used to migrate
V0 data to V1 data types.

Package dkls implements the 2-of-2 threshold ECDSA signing algorithm of
[Secure Two-party Threshold ECDSA from ECDSA Assumptions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/499).
